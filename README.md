## A Python script to automate making folders and subfolders for classes
I was getting very annoyed with having to create the folders manually, so I just wrote down a script to do it for me.
The script generates a semester folder, class subfolders, and assignments, notes, and slides subfolders within those class subfolders.

## Instructions
Place the folderGenerator.py file into whichever directory you want your semester folder, and run it.
